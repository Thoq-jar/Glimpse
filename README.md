# Glimpse Commandline Utils

A collection of command line utilities to save Windows users

## rm
Windows’s rm is practically useless. Whenever I inevitably have to interface with Windows, I tend to use PowerShell as it’s closer to ZSH and Bash than cmd. But when i try to remove a file with rm, I get permission denied or could not delete even with -r. So grm (glimpse remove) will bypass this, if you use it to delete a folder with contents, use the -f flag.

## ls
I hate how complex the ls command is on windows.
## 
no reason other than for fun :)
